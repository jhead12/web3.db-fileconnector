**Date:** $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")

## Overview

This document contains the results of the security audit for web3db-connector and the remediation steps taken.

## Fixed Vulnerabilities

The following direct dependencies were patched to secure versions:

$(printf "* %s\n" "${DIRECT_DEPS[@]}")

## Transitive Dependencies

The following transitive dependencies were handled through yarn resolutions:

$(printf "* %s\n" "${TRANSITIVE_DEPS[@]}")

## Remaining Vulnerabilities

Some transitive dependencies may still report vulnerabilities because they are deeply nested in the dependency tree and cannot be easily patched without breaking compatibility. These are documented below:

1. Some dependencies within @composedb/devtools and @ceramicnetwork/cli packages may still report vulnerabilities.
2. The project team should consider upgrading these dependencies in a future minor release.
3. Most critical security issues have been addressed in the current version.

## Recommendation

Before deploying to production, review any remaining vulnerabilities and assess their risk based on your specific deployment environment.
